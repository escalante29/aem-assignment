# AEM-backend-assignment

Intention:

Make an OSGi service component that returns a list of products which can be filtered by their category.


## Bonus:

List down the number of ways to implement the category filter:

- Sling models and HTL templates (used in this approach)
- Using AEMs Tagging Framework
- Using AEMs QueryBuilder API
- Via Javascript calling a Sling servlet or Sling models and the @Exporter annotation
